# YidhrasChild 2.0
Based on the Game [Yidras Child for the Global Game Jam 2017 - Bremen](https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/yidhraschild)

(Because some of the Assets were not completely for publishing under CC-BY-SA 3.0 some of them were redone with own ones in Blender - we also updated the code and fixed some bugs so this is "2.0")

# Story & How to Play
Yidhras Child is a First Person Shooter on a Space Station. You are an astronaut on the Scientific Space Station Beagle. You start in the security area of the ship and need to go to the Main Control Room to change the oxygen levels. You notice that there are Saboteurs on the ship that work against you because you hear them smashing doors. So you grab your weapon and your gravity gun and go. You can shoot bullets (on key 1) or a gravity field (on key 2) with your gun. You can only have one field. Every few seconds a solar wave (like a solar wind) occurs that destroys your gravity field. You can use the field to put enemies on the wall or to get to another level.
